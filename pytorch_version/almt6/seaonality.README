We first applied STL decomposition under the assumption of an additive structure, meaning the observed data can be expressed as the sum of three components: trend, seasonality, and residuals. The trend component captures the long-term progression in the data, while the seasonal component isolates recurring patterns at fixed intervalsâ€”in our case, both quarterly and monthly effects were considered. The residual component represents unexplained variation, including irregular shocks or noise. Each of these components carries interpretive significance: the trend highlights structural growth or decline, the seasonal part reveals cyclical behaviors, and the residuals indicate randomness or external events not captured by systematic variation.

Upon inspection of the seasonal component, we found that its scale was relatively small, accounting for less than 10% of the total variability in the original series. To evaluate its practical impact, we calculated the correlation between the residuals and the original series. The high correlation suggested that even after removing the seasonal and trend components, the residuals still strongly resembled the original series, implying that seasonality and trend together contributed minimally to explaining the overall variation in this dataset.

To further validate this finding, we computed the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the reconstructed series and the original series. Specifically, we compared the RMSE from the full reconstruction (trend plus seasonality) against the reconstruction that excluded the seasonal component (trend only). The RMSE increased by only 2.5% when the seasonal component was removed, confirming that seasonality played a negligible role in improving reconstruction accuracy. This small change reinforces the interpretation that the seasonal signal is weak relative to the overall scale of the data.

Lastly, we quantified the strength of seasonality using the variance-based measure defined in the decomposition framework. In this approach, the variance of the residuals is compared against the variance of the detrended series (trend removed but seasonality retained). If the residual variance is almost as large as the detrended variance, the calculated seasonal strength will be close to zero, meaning that the seasonal component explains little additional variability. Conversely, if the residual variance is much smaller, the strength approaches one, indicating strong seasonality. In our case, the values were close to zero, confirming that recurring seasonal patterns contributed minimally compared to trend and random variation.
