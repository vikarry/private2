As an intern within the ALM Treasury North America modeling and IRR metrics team, my mission was to contribute to the critical function of risk measurement and management for BNP Paribas Group's North American operations. My role centered on developing and maintaining sophisticated statistical models that predict customer behavior patterns—including early repayment options, deposit outflows, and off-balance sheet drawdowns—while accounting for evolving economic and financial conditions. Working within a team responsible for ensuring financially sound risk measurement methods, I leveraged advanced Python programming to build robust data pipelines, scale machine learning models, and automate workflows that support timely delivery of interest rate risk indicators to ALMT Committees. My position bridged the gap between theoretical financial mathematics and practical risk management, contributing to the protection of BNP Paribas Group's financial signature while supporting liquidity and interest rate risk assessment across the Combined US Operations and Canadian activities.

During my internship, I focused on two distinct but complementary projects that deepened my understanding of financial risk modeling. My primary project involved statistical performance monitoring for prepayment risk models, which forms a crucial component of the broader liquidity risk framework at BNP Paribas. This work required me to thoroughly analyze existing implementations, understand the underlying statistical foundations, and identify opportunities for enhancement while ensuring model accuracy and reliability. My secondary project centered on machine learning applications for forecasting uncertainties in market conditions, which expanded my expertise in predictive modeling under volatile financial environments. My daily approach involved first gaining a comprehensive understanding of each problem's context and business impact, then methodically reviewing current implementations to grasp the technical architecture and methodology. From there, I would either work to replicate previous results on new datasets to validate model robustness, or develop targeted improvements to enhance model performance and accuracy.

Coming from a theoretical deep learning background focused on biological applications, I discovered that transitioning to financial data presented unique and unexpected challenges that fundamentally shifted my understanding of machine learning applications. While my academic foundation in deep learning provided strong technical skills, I quickly learned that financial data operates in a completely different realm—characterized by inherent noise, market randomness, and complex behavioral patterns that don't follow the more predictable structures I was accustomed to in biological datasets. The most significant realization was understanding how financial markets are influenced by human psychology, economic cycles, and external events that create data patterns far more volatile and unpredictable than biological systems. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, I learned the critical importance of making reasonable simplifying assumptions—but these assumptions are not arbitrary choices. Rather, they must be backed by extensive financial knowledge and deep understanding of market behaviors, regulatory frameworks, and economic principles. This experience taught me that successful financial modeling requires not just technical proficiency, but also substantial domain expertise to make informed assumptions that capture essential risk dynamics while maintaining model reliability and business relevance.

Working within the ALM Treasury modeling team has been an exceptionally positive experience, largely due to the team's outstanding dynamics and collaborative culture. The team members are remarkably chill and approachable, creating an environment where questions are welcomed and knowledge sharing is encouraged at every level. Their deep expertise in financial risk modeling is matched by their genuine willingness to help, whether explaining complex statistical concepts or providing guidance on practical implementation challenges. This supportive atmosphere allowed me to make meaningful progress on identifying areas for model improvement, contributing real value to ongoing projects while building my confidence in tackling complex financial problems. Beyond my immediate team, the broader BNPP environment exemplifies excellence in financial services, with a strong emphasis on innovation, risk management, and professional development. The organization's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology while maintaining rigorous risk standards creates an ideal learning environment for emerging professionals. The hybrid work arrangements and structured internship program demonstrate BNPP's investment in talent development, while the international scope of operations provides exposure to global financial markets and diverse perspectives.

One area for improvement would be implementing more standardized documentation and reproducibility practices for modeling projects. Establishing formal protocols for code documentation, model versioning, and systematic tracking of assumptions and data sources would significantly benefit knowledge transfer and project sustainability.
Cross-Team Collaboration Opportunities: Establishing more structured interactions with other ALMT teams and Risk departments to provide broader exposure to different aspects of financial risk management and organizational workflows.
Extended Project Timeline and Scope: Allowing more time for deep-dive analysis and model optimization, potentially through longer internship duration or more focused project assignments to enable more comprehensive contributions to ongoing initiatives.

Overall, my internship experience at BNPP has been exceptionally well-structured and supportive, making it challenging to identify significant areas for improvement. The balance between independent work and mentorship was particularly well-calibrated—I felt trusted to take ownership of my projects and explore solutions autonomously, while knowing that guidance and support were readily available when needed. The HR team deserves special recognition for organizing engaging networking events and professional development sessions that enhanced the internship experience
