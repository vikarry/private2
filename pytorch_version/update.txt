1. Data downloading:

Triton database -> on the top left select [Reports] -> CIB -> Global Banking -> Global Banking Balance Sheet
Copy the report snippet from ALMT6.txt then select Reports -> load Report Snippet Paste and load the snippet. Make sure to change the date to the desired month and year.
To export the report, right click -> Export

Save all the month's report in a single folder. Run data_preprocess.py to process and concatenate all months into a single file.

2. In main.py, provide the data path for all previous data and the new year's data
Change trans = True for blended and trans=false for unblended on line 564. Make sure to change the output dir path accordingly.
In the output, you should see 8 files:
	1. RCF_UNDRAWN_COMMITED
	2. RCF_DRAWN
	3. Other_UNDRAWN_COMMITED
	4. Other_DRAWN
	5. exposure_ RCF_UNDRAWN_COMMITED
	6. exposure_RCF_DRAWN
	7. exposure_Other_UNDRAWN_COMMITED
	8. exposure_Other_DRAWN

Open Other_DRAWN and RCF_DRAWN and new_methods.xlsx
1. In the tab, for example,  NEW_METHOD_Blended_RCF, copy from RCF_DRAWN the over to the new_Methods these columns:
	1. the date starting from 9/30/19 to the current month
	2. exposure
	3. repay
2. Make sure the plot is using all data
3. Repeat for Blended_Other, Unblended_Other, Unblended_RCF
4. Save the plots and add to the performance monitoring documentation

For Prime rate analysis
1. Download the prime rate data from federal reserve
2. Update the tab 'US Prime loan rate' in new_Methods.xlsx
3. Calculate the bench mark: the average of the prime rate of the calibration period
4. Update in the performance monitoring documentation on whether the average prime loan rate during the PM period changed more than 50pb or 30%
5. To compute the plot, copy over prepayment rate for Unblended_RCF

For OTD analysis
1. Uncomment the line at 368 in main.py to produce '_res.csv' files
2. Run the otd_monthly_calc.py to produce the OTD_FLAG files
3. Sort and filter COB date for after 9/30/2019
4. Select COB date and otdFlag column to generate plot
5. Repeat for all scenarios

For top_K Monthly analysis
1. Produce the 'res.csv's (see OTD analysis section) and edit the file path in analyze_top_k_monthly.py
2. Specify the starting date of the analysis in line 76 and run the script
3. The file will output each prepayment proportions relative to the total prepayment of the month and calculate it's z-score, amount larger than 100M is worth taking a look at based on previous patterns

For seasonality analysis
1. Specify the file paths at the top
2. Run seasonality_analysis.py to produce seasonality decomposition plots
